# Visual website builder

Okay so… I grew up playing with Visual Basic Classic (shoutout if you remember that), and it honestly got me into design in the first place. Lately, I’ve been wondering what would a futuristic version of that look like today, especially with AI in the mix? So I started messing around… and this project kinda just happened.

This isn’t some polished product, more like a playground where I explore what the interface of AI could feel like. things like:

- Do people actually enjoy chatting with AI to build stuff?
- Would they rather click and drag?
- What if it’s a mix of both?
- What’s the smoothest way to collaborate with an AI?

So yeah, this project is me following that curiosity. A bunch of little experiments wrapped in a visual website builder.

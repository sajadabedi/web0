# Visual website builder

Okay soâ€¦ I grew up playing with Visual Basic Classic (shoutout if you remember that ðŸ‘´), and it honestly got me into design in the first place. Lately, Iâ€™ve been wondering â€” what would a futuristic version of that look like today, especially with AI in the mix? So I started messing aroundâ€¦ and this project kinda just happened.

This isnâ€™t some polished product, more like a playground where I explore what the interface of AI could feel like. Like:
â€“ Do people actually enjoy chatting with AI to build stuff?
â€“ Would they rather click and drag?
â€“ What if itâ€™s a mix of both?
â€“ Whatâ€™s the smoothest way to collaborate with an AI?

So yeah, this project is me following that curiosity. A bunch of little experiments wrapped in a visual website builder.
